<h1> Booking Terms and Conditions

</h1>
<p> Please read these terms and conditions carefully. When you make a booking, you
accept on behalf of your party the terms of these booking conditions. It is your responsibility
to ensure that all of the details on your confirmation documents are correct and to bring to
our attention any errors or discrepancies within 48 hours of your booking.</p>

<h1>BOOKINGS AND QUOTES</h1>
<p>Bookings can be made over the internet at www.byronbeachabodes.com.au or by calling
on 593 44 03 83. Reservations are subject to availability and actual pricing at the time of
booking. Verbal quotes are valid for 24 hours only. Any verbal quote given is an estimate
only of price, which will be subject to a written advice on confirmation of booking. You
agree to pay the rate for each night of your stay and any additional charges up until the
time you have departed the accommodation. The accommodation may be occupied by
you only for the period stated on the booking confirmation.</p>
<h1>PAYMENT POLICY
</h1>
<p>Full payment is required at time of booking. If payment is not received by the due date,
Byron Beach Abodes reserves the right to cancel the booking. </p>
<h1>PAYMENT OPTIONS
</h1>
<p>Payments are accepted by credit cards, Visa, MasterCard or AMEX. Credit card payments
incur a 1% surcharge and a AMEX 1.9% surcharge. All payments are only accepted in Us
dollars. Payments can be accepted via direct deposit</p>
<h1>CANCELLATION TERMS & CHARGES
</h1>
<p>If you cancel with 3 or more months notice prior to your arrival date a 20% cancellation fee
will be incurred. If you cancel between 3-1 month prior to your arrival date a 35%
cancellation fee of the booking total will be incurred. If you cancel within 30 days of your
arrival date a 50% cancellation fee of the booking total will be incurred.
If you cancel less than 14 days prior to your arrival date 100% of the booking total will be
retained.
No cancellations are accepted on the day of arrival or after check in. You will be charged
the total of the reserved stay under all circumstances. Written notification must be provided
for all cancellations</p>
<h1>NUMBER OF GUESTS
</h1>
<p>At no time during your occupancy is the number of guests staying to exceed the number
booked, unless prior approval is sought and given by management. The use of extra beds
other than the number booked will attract an additional tariff. Any persons exceeding the
maximum occupancy of the property will be considered trespassers and will be evicted.
The maximum number of guests permitted in each property type is as follows: The Chapel -
2 guests (adults only), The Cottage - 6 guests, The Chalet – 6 guests, Magnolia House – 8
guests.</p>
<h1> CHECK IN & CHECK OUT
</h1>
<p>Standard check in time is 3.00pm and accommodation is to be vacated by 11.00 am on
the day of departure. An additional fee will be charged if you do not check out by 11.00
am. Early arrivals and late check outs are at the discretion of Management and must be
requested at the time of booking and can only be confirmed 1 day prior to arrival or
departure. Whilst every effort will be made to accommodate early arrivals and late
departures, the only way to absolutely ensure early check-in or late check-out is to book an
extra night or half day where availability permits. Half day rates are charged at 50% of the
nightly tariff and will extend the check out time until 3:00 pm and allow an early check in
from 10:00 am. </p>
<h1>CLEANING 
</h1>

<p> Extra cleaning and linen change can be arranged during your stay for an additional
charge, at a cost to you. Please contact management for further details. On departure,
your accommodation is to be left in a clean and tidy state. Extra cleaning charges will
apply if this condition is breached and will be deducted from your deposit or credit card. </p>
<div>
  <h1>SMOKING</h1>
  <p> Smoking inside any accommodation is strictly prohibited. If there is any evidence of smoking
inside the accommodation you will be charged an additional $1000 for a specialised clean
to eliminate odours. Please ensure doors and windows are closed if smoking on balconies or
in courtyards.
</p>
<h1> PERSONAL BELONGINGS
</h1>
<p>You acknowledge that we do not cover your personal belongings under our insurance
policy and therefore take no responsibility for any loss or damage of the occupant’s
personal property left on the premises and agree that you will not make any claim against
us for any damages or loss to your personal belongings regardless of how or where the loss
or damage occurred. </p>
<h1>BEHAVIOUR</h1>
<p>Parties or gatherings are strictly prohibited, unless prior arrangements have been made with
Management. Disturbance to other accommodation guests and neighbours including
excessive noise and music is prohibited and may result in eviction without refund. If a noise
complaint is received a first warning will be given, if a second complaint is received this will
result in immediate eviction with no refund.</p>
<h1>BREAKAGES AND DAMAGES
</h1>
<p>Upon check out accommodation should be left clean and tidy. Damages or breakages of
furniture or furnishings must be reported to Management immediately. Breakages or
damages to the property and all communal or external areas that are caused by any guest
and/or a guest’s visitor will be charged and recouped in full of the guest’s credit card or
deducted from the guest’s refundable deposit. Excess cleaning required on departure or
replacement of items removed from the accommodation will be charged to the guest’s
credit card. Furniture, fixtures and fittings are not to be altered or moved between rooms or
properties. There will be a charge incurred if furniture is not returned to its original location.</p>
